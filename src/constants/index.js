  `I am a dedicated and versatile full stack developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. My journey in web development began while building a simple quiz web application for students during COVID in Vanilla JS with the single question
`,
  ` "How is hoisting even possible if JavaScript is an interpreted language?"`,
  `From that point on, my curioisity and obsession with uncovering how JS works in the browser began, extended further into the workings of web development, and it has evolved into a career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions.
